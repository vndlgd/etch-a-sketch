## Live Demo
You can try out the live demo of the game [here](https://vndlgd.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

## Overview
This project is a part of the curriculum provided by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The Etch-a-Sketch project aims to create a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

## Description
The virtual canvas consists of a grid of squares, and as the user hovers the mouse over the squares, their color changes. This provides a simple and interactive way to create drawings and designs.

## Usage
- Choose the desired grid dimensions. 
- Hover the mouse over the squares in the canvas to change their color.
